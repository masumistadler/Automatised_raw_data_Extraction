## Respiration raw data ##

# Authored by: Masumi Stadler

# This script extracts the raw data of Fibox3 (PreSens) from txt files
# be aware that this is only for oxygen data
# differences in output txt files from CO2 mini has to be changed in line 61 (i.e. how many lines to skip)
# and check whether the column arrangement is different

# Default output txt file of Fibox, the script skips the first 58 rows that does not include the data
# the default column names have characters problematic in R, thus use the following vector if you need
# the column names at any point
colnames.o2 <- c("Date","Time","Logtime.min","Oxygen","Phase","Amplitude","Temperature", "ErrorMessage")
# Units: Date = DD/MM/YY, Time = hh:mm:ss, Oxygen = mg/L (ppm), Temperature = Â°C

############## IMPORTANT ##############
# To process the data without changing the script, arrange/save your files in the following order of folders
# Respiration / *Sample_name* / *Respiration_type* / *Replicate* / *Timepoint*.txt
# where Sample_name is a unique identifier for each of your samples
# Respiration type is either TR and/or BR in separate folders
# Replicate: folder A and B
# Timepoint as in T0, T1, ..., Tn.txt
